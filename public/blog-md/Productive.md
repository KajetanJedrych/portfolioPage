# The Chaos of Starting… and Never Finishing

We all get 24 hours. And not everyone starts from the same place — some people commute, others have kids, pets that need long walks, or a million other daily obligations. That’s why step one is simple but important: be honest about your day.

Start by writing down what your ideal day looks like. No emergencies, no surprises. Just a smooth, focused day. Then schedule it.

Here’s mine:

- **7:00** – Wake up, stretch, quick workout, shower  
- **7:30–9:00** – Work on personal projects  
- **9:00–17:00** – Remote work  
- **17:00–19:00** – Gym or a run  
- **19:00–20:00** – Cook dinner and prep lunch for the next day  
- **20:00–22:00** – Either another hour on projects, or downtime with my fiancée (a walk or an episode of something)  
- **22:00–23:00** – No screens. Just reading.  
- **23:00** – Sleep

This is my "gold standard." It’s written in my calendar. And when life doesn’t get in the way, I follow it. That gives me around **2 focused hours per day** for personal projects. It might not sound like much, but over a month, that’s about 50 hours of real, usable time.

## Avoid Constant Project-Switching

You know the drill: you’re halfway through a project, then a shiny new idea pops into your head. Suddenly you’re starting something new again, and the cycle repeats.

To avoid this, I started treating my personal projects like actual work — with goals, deadlines, and finish lines.

Here’s what helps me:

1. Write down all your current projects or ideas.
2. For each one, define a clear objective and a “minimum done” condition.  
   What does “finished” look like? What’s the exit condition?
3. Rank them by priority or potential.  
   Then pick one (maybe two max) to focus on. That’s it.

For example, here’s my current setup (I manage it in Miro using digital sticky notes):

- **Master’s Thesis**  
  - *Priority:* High  
  - *Deadline:* End of May  
  - *Done Condition:* Approved by my advisor

- **My briliant new app**  
  - *Priority:* Medium  
  - *Deadline:* Open  
  - *Done Condition:* Fully deployed on iOS and Android

When I sit down to work, I open Miro, look at my board, and start with the highest priority task. If I’m juggling two projects, I alternate by **weeks**, not days — daily context-switching was wrecking my focus. Week-on, week-off works way better.

Each main goal also has sub-tasks like “write login page” or “finish chapter 5.” Checking those off gives me that little dopamine hit — and makes progress feel real.

## Say It Out Loud

This one’s not for everyone, but it really works for me: **Tell people what you’re working on.**

If you mention your project to friends, family, or post about it online, guess what happens? People ask about it. And no one wants to say,  
“Yeah… I haven’t touched it in weeks.”

It adds just enough pressure to keep going. That little dose of accountability is often all I need to push through.

There are a ton of other techniques out there — like rewarding yourself after a productive day, or changing your environment (working from a café, for example, to force focus). But for me, these are my personal **Pareto Principle**: the 20% that gives me 80% of the results.

- Plan your ideal day and protect your project time.  
- Define clear goals, choose one or two, and actually stick with them.  
- Make it public — let accountability work for you.

Thanks to this system, I’ve been able to write my thesis, work full-time, and still make progress on my own apps. And the best part? Some of them — I actually finish now.
