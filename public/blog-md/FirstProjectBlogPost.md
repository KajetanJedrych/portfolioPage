After falling into a new YouTube rabbit hole, I discovered something that completely captivated me: **solo entrepreneurship**.

Watching creators like Marc Lou or channels like *Starter Story*, with titles like *“This App Makes Me \$10K/Month”*, I got totally hooked. The idea that you could live anywhere, work on your own projects, and make more than a regular job sounded like the dream. So I decided to give it a shot.

It actually came at a perfect time. I was halfway through my Master’s degree in web development, already juggling multiple projects in different technologies. On top of that, I’ve been working as a QA developer for the past four years, and I have a Bachelor's in computer science. The only thing left was to choose a tech stack and build my million-dollar idea.

I’ve been collecting ideas for a while, so I picked something simple to start with: **a website with calculators**.

I use online calculators all the time — for compound interest, taxes, or estimating how much I’ll save in a retirement fund. But each of these tools is on a different website. So I thought, *why not bring them all together in one place?* And that’s how the idea for the site was born.

I started building it using React, TypeScript, and Vite. It was going well — until I got assigned a university project that had to be done using Next.js. So I rebuilt the whole thing from scratch. At the time, it was a bit frustrating, but looking back, switching to Next.js was a great decision. I learned a ton about the differences between Vite and Next — definitely a hidden win.

With the app built, it was time to deploy. After watching some horror stories about how Vercel can hit you with surprise charges — especially for things like tracking scripts or misconfigured APIs — I decided to self-host instead. I found this awesome tool called **Coolify** (free and surprisingly powerful), paired it with the cheapest **Hetzner** server I could find for just €4/month, and spent a full Sunday setting it all up.

By the end of the day, my site was live:  
🔗 **[Kalkulatory.org](https://kalkulatory.org)**

Next, I tried experimenting with monetization. I added a few small Google AdSense banners just to learn how it all works. But wow — it was harder than I expected. Google rejected my site **six times**, each time giving vague or unhelpful feedback. After a month of trying and tweaking, I gave up.

And honestly? I’m okay with that. I’m the only one using the site anyway.

So yeah — the site is online, and it’ll probably stay that way until the domain expires next year. I’ll still be the only user, and that doesn’t bother me one bit. The real goal was to test myself — to see if I could actually start and finish something. That’s always been a challenge for me.

And this time, I did it.

Also... I already have another idea lined up. One I thought didn’t exist. Turns out, it didn’t exist *for a reason* — but that’s a story for another post.
