After completing my "training mission" by building a simple calculator site, I felt ready for a real project — something that could actually make money.

I went back to my list of ideas and found it: an app that pulls comments from social media and uses AI to extract the key insights, so you don’t have to read them all manually.

At first, I thought this was genius. It had “AI” in the name — and everything with AI these days seems to sell ten times better. I could already imagine YouTubers with tens of thousands of comments fighting over access to this magical comment analyzer.

So I jumped straight into building. This time, I used **Next.js** and **React** as the base, along with **Tailwind CSS** for styling — tools I was already comfortable with. Since I work a regular 9-to-5 job as a QA developer, I could only commit to an hour or two each morning. After work it’s gym, dinner, time with my girlfriend — and suddenly, the day’s over. So I shifted my focus hours to the early morning, just to make sure I kept momentum.

After a few days, I had a landing page. But I wasn’t ready to show it to anyone yet. I figured I’d wait until I had a working prototype.

That took a few more days. Along the way, I learned a lot — like how many different ways there are to convert text from a Google API into a PDF. I tested several before I finally found one that actually worked for me.

Then I connected **Gemini AI’s API**. To my surprise, it worked immediately — I was bracing for a struggle, but it just… worked. At that point, the app was functional. Of course, it still lacked basic features like login and a database. So I moved on to authentication using **Auth.js**. That part took longer than I expected, but eventually, I got registration and login working.

That’s when I thought,  
**“Okay, let’s validate this idea. Does anyone actually want this?”**

Turns out… not really.

The realization came slowly, but it started to make sense. On YouTube, when creators upload a video, they usually skim through the top-liked comments — which already reflect the general sentiment. There’s rarely anything groundbreaking buried deep in the thread.

So yeah, another project headed to the archive. But honestly? I learned a ton. And more importantly, I now have a solid foundation I can reuse for future apps.

As for my next project — it’s something I actually use. I decided to find a product I personally rely on, then build a better or more beautiful version of it.

What is it, exactly?  
I’ll reveal that soon.

For now, all I know is:  
I need to learn React Native.
