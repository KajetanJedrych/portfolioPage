# I Just Finished My Master's Degree at a Private University in Poland — Was It Worth It? 🎓

Hey! I'm 26 years old, and I just wrapped up what feels like the longest project of my life: 20 years of formal education. One year of kindergarten, six years of primary school, three years of middle school, four years of technical high school, four years for my engineering degree, and two more for a master's.

Whew 😴.

So, now that I’ve officially graduated from WSB Merito — a private university in Poland — and closed this educational chapter, I figured it’s time to share my thoughts. Spoiler: I don’t regret it. But let’s not pretend it was as shiny and perfect as in the brochures 🌟.

Here's what I’ll cover:

- 🏫 A short history of my education
- 💸 The cost
- 👍 The good
- 👎 The bad
- ❓ And the big question: was it worth it?

## My Educational Background 📚

I went through primary and middle school in a small Polish town — the kind of place where the education system isn’t exactly world-class. For high school, I chose a technical school instead of a general one because it offered something practical: IT. I went for a telecom-informatics program, which sounded cooler and more niche than “just” IT.

It turned out to be a great intro to tech. At the time, I had no idea how useful this early foundation would be — but once I got to university, I realized I had a serious head start 🏁.

So if you’re considering between a general high school and a technical one, and you know you’re aiming for a tech career — I’d say that extra year in tech school is absolutely worth it ✅.

## Choosing a University 🏫

When it came time to pick a university, my main decision-making factor was... money 💰. Shocking, I know.

Daily (full-time) studies weren’t an option — I needed to work full-time. So I started looking into part-time options.

WSB Merito offered the best deal overall. Closest to me, a technical university — Gdańsk University of Technology — charged significantly more for weekend studies. So I went with WSB and focused on building my career in parallel. Looking back, it was the right call 💼.

Now that I’ve graduated, I’m not starting from scratch — I’ve already got 5 years of experience in various IT roles. Considering how much tougher the market is for juniors today than it was five years ago, this decision paid off big time 💪.

## The Cost of Education 💸

Let’s talk numbers. I’ll only focus on tuition here, since housing, food, and other living costs are too personal and variable to generalize.

During my studies at WSB, I went from living with my parents to renting, and finally to buying my own apartment (with a mortgage, obviously 🏠). None of this would’ve been possible without full-time work, which studying part-time allowed.

### Engineering Degree (7 semesters, 2019–2022):

- Paid per semester (not monthly, which got me some discounts)
- Total cost: 18,105 PLN (~$5,000)
- I didn’t fail any subjects (no extra fees)
- I earned a Rector’s scholarship (about 1,250 PLN ($350) each in 4 semesters = 5,000 PLN ($1,390))
- Final cost: 13,105 PLN (~$3,640)

🎯 If you’re really academically gifted and can maintain top performance, your total cost could easily drop below **10,000 PLN (~$2,780)**.

### Master’s Degree (4 semesters):

- Total tuition: 15,000 PLN (~$4,170)
- Got the Rector’s scholarship twice (2 × 1,500 PLN (~$420))
- Final cost: 13,500 PLN (~$3,750)

### Grand Total:

- **33,105 PLN (~$9,190)**
- After subtracting all scholarships: **26,605 PLN (~$7,390)**
- 🧠 And again — with more hustle and better grades, it could realistically be closer to **20,000 PLN (~$5,560)**.

## The Pros (aka the “Stuff That Made It Worth It”) ✅

Let’s not live up to the stereotype of Poles always complaining 😅, so here’s what I genuinely liked:

### 1. Young, Industry-Active Teaching Staff 👨‍🏫👩‍💻

A lot of my lecturers were working professionals. This is a double-edged sword (more on that in the cons), but in general, it was great.

They taught modern tools and techniques, offered real-world advice, and weren’t stuck teaching 1990s JavaBeans or how to burn CDs 💽.

### 2. Affordable Tuition + Scholarships 🏷️

For what I paid, I think the education I got was solid — especially considering the scholarship opportunities and the fact that I could study while building my career.

### 3. My Fellow Students 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

Being part of a group where almost everyone was already working or aiming to work in IT was super motivating 💼💬.

We weren’t best friends, but even just being connected on LinkedIn has already opened doors.  
We were like a low-budget version of an Ivy League alumni network 😄.

### 4. Free Courses & Certificates 📜

WSB offered a bunch of side courses — some even with certifications.

I completed ISTQB training, GitHub courses, and most importantly, got a Python PCAP certificate — all for free 💡.

There were also Erasmus exchange opportunities 🌍. I couldn’t take part, but some friends went to the UK and Spain and said it was incredible. I regret missing out on that 😔.

### 5. Lots of Projects 💻

I love learning by doing, and these studies gave me a ton of hands-on assignments.

I developed a habit of spending two hours every morning on my own side projects — a habit I still maintain post-graduation ☕🛠️.

## The Cons (Okay, Let’s Complain Now) 😤

### 1. Chaos in Organization 📅❌

This was... rough.

Classes being canceled last minute, schedule changes without notice, emails never answered, student office lines so long they made the DMV look efficient — you name it 🧾.

It got slightly better during the master’s program, or maybe I just became numb to it. Either way — not great.

### 2. 13-Hour Lecture Days 🧠💥

Some weekends were brutal — 8 AM to 9 PM with just short food breaks.

After working all week, this kind of schedule fried my brain.  
On the plus side, collective suffering builds friendships. Our whole class bonded over mutual hatred for whoever made the schedule 🤝🔥.

### 3. Not All Professors Were Up to Standard 🧐

Especially during the master’s program, I encountered a few lecturers who clearly didn’t have a strong grasp of the subject.

In some cases, students knew more than the instructor 😬. The focus then became: “Just pass this class and move on.”  
A complete waste of time, honestly.

## So... Was It Worth It? ❓

**Absolutely.**

The money I spent came back quickly thanks to my job. The knowledge and network I gained are still valuable. The time I spent in class? Well, if I hadn’t been studying, I probably would’ve just spent it gaming or partying 🎮🍻.

Sure, I missed a few birthdays and weekend trips. But I learned to really value my free time — because during those years, I had very little of it ⏳.

Though now, when I sit down to relax or play a game, I still get that tiny brain-itch saying, _“Shouldn’t you be doing something productive?”_  
Thanks, academic guilt! 😅

So yes — if you're motivated and willing to put in the work, I can recommend **WSB Merito**.

But if you think simply showing up will magically change your life — it won’t.  
You’ll need to study, build projects, and take initiative. Getting a 3.0 (the bare minimum pass) is easy. But pushing for a 5.0? That’s where you actually grow 📈.

If you believe a Master’s diploma alone will open all doors for you — the job market will be quick to humble you 💼🔨.
